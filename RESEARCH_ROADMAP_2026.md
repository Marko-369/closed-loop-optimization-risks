# Extensions and Future Research Ideas

*Grounded in validated results (n=2000, Shannon p<0.001)*
*Last updated: February 2026*

## Priority 1: Immediate Experiments (Low Cost, High Value)

### 1.1 Temperature Sweep (BLOCKED by API)
*Status: On Hold (API constraints).*

### 1.2 Exogenous Dose-Response
*Question*: What is the minimum injection ratio that prevents collapse?
*Cost*: ~$30

### 1.3 Phase Transition Detection
*Question*: Is there a sharp transition at t* ≈ 15 iterations?
*Cost*: ~$10

### 1.4 Recovery Experiment ("Lazare Protocol")
*Question*: Can a collapsed system recover with late exogenous injection?
*Prediction*: Partial recovery but not full restoration — hysteresis effect.
*Cost*: ~$1 (Low) - **NEXT PRIORITY**

## Priority 2 to 4: Long Term Goals
(See full internal documentation for metrics, architecture, and theoretical extensions.)

## Experiment Priority Matrix
| Experiment | Cost | Impact | Feasibility | Priority |
|-----------|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Recovery ("Lazare") | $1 | Very High | Easy | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Dose-response | $30 | Very High | Easy | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Semantic Embeddings | $5 | High | Medium | ⭐⭐ |
