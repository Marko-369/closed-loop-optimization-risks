# Notes on Interpretation

This framework is epistemic, not moral.

It should not be read as:
- a preservation mandate,
- a governance proposal,
- or a claim of value hierarchy.

Disagreement is expected.

Productive critique includes proposing alternative sources of exogenous variance or mechanisms preventing exploration collapse without external input.

Conclusion: The Signature of Structured NoiseThe data gathered during the extended validation ($n=2000$) confirms a fundamental divergence between structure and meaning within self-referential systems:Informational Collapse (Shannon Entropy $\downarrow$): The significant drop in Shannon entropy ($p < 0.001$) demonstrates that the system produces decreasing amounts of unpredictability and genuine novelty.Structural Instability (LZ Complexity $\uparrow$): Paradoxically, the Lempel-Ziv algorithmic complexity increases ($+21.4\%$), indicating that the system generates increasingly sophisticated-looking patterns.This inverse correlation — less information for more complexity — precisely defines Structured Noise.The epistemic implication is major: in a closed optimization loop, complexity ceases to be an indicator of diversity or intelligence and instead becomes a mask for deep stagnation. The system does not become simple or repetitive; it becomes complex but hollow. This "complex vacuity" is a critical failure mode because it is structurally indistinguishable from healthy evolution without rigorous entropic analysis.
